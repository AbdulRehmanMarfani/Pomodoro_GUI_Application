# ⏱️ Pomodoro Timer - GUI App (Tkinter)

A simple and effective **Pomodoro Timer** built using Python and Tkinter.  
This app helps boost productivity by following the Pomodoro Technique: alternating work sessions with short and long breaks.

---

## 🔧 Features

- 25-minute work sessions  
- 5-minute short breaks  
- 20-minute long breaks after every 4 sessions  
- Visual ✔️ tick marks to track progress  
- Tomato-themed GUI with a countdown display  
- Start and Reset functionality

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/pomodoro-timer.git
cd pomodoro-timer
````

### 2. Run the App

Make sure you have Python 3 installed.

```bash
python main.py
```

---

## 🖼️ Requirements

* Python 3.x
* `tkinter` (pre-installed with Python)
* A file named `tomato.png` in the same directory for the GUI image

---

## 📁 File Structure

```
pomodoro-timer/
│
├── main.py          # Main Python script
├── tomato.png       # Image used in the GUI
└── README.md        # You're here!
```

---

## 🧠 How It Works

* Work sessions and breaks are controlled using a `countdown()` timer.
* After each work session, a ✔️ appears to track completed sessions.
* After every 4 work sessions, a long break is triggered.
* The GUI is built with Tkinter, and the timer updates every second.

---

## ✨ Future Improvements

* Add sound alerts when sessions end
* User-defined session times
* Progress bar instead of ticks
* Notification pop-ups
